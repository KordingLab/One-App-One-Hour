# One App, One Hour

This repository contains a set of applications developed in under one hour at the [Kording Lab _Lab Teaching_](http://kordinglab.com/2021/01/01/upcoming-lab-teaching.html).

They are designed to show general architecture, and should not necessarily be used as a model for best coding practices.
